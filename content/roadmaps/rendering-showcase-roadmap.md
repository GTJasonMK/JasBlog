## Goal

Use this roadmap to validate `/roadmap` list and detail rendering behavior.

- [x] Prepare base module structure `low`
  Build content folders, route wiring, and list/detail pages.

- [-] Add rich showcase content across pages `high`
  Cover notes, projects, graphs, diary, and roadmap examples.

- [ ] Polish copy and spacing `medium`
  Align wording and visual spacing across all modules.

- [ ] Add repeatable regression checklist `medium`
  Define a quick page-by-page manual validation flow.

## Extra Notes

The tasks above should drive progress stats and per-task status tags on roadmap pages.
